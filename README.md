On my first day i worked on 3D models with Felipe, a brazilian engineer.
On my second day i was paired with Evan, an Irish mechanical engineer, we presuer tested pipes.
On my third day i dismanteld the last set of pipes before presuer testing the next two sets of pipes.
On my fourth day i dismanteled and presuer tested the last of the pipes.
On my final day i cleaned the doors of the fuel intake cabintes they were bulding before learing (roughly) how to weld.
