#### A week in Fleury Engineering
On my first day i worked with Felipe, a Brazilian engineer.
- I sat with Felipe as he worked on 3D models on a [CAD](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/CAD-computer-aided-design) package

On my second day i was paired with Evan, an Irish mechanical engineer.
- We pressure tested pipes by filing them with water and pupming in more till it was 13 [BAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit))

On my third day i was working with Evan again.
- i dismantled the last set of pipes before pressure testing the next two sets of pipes.

On my fourth day i was paired with Evan for the third time.
- i dismantled and pressure tested the last of the pipes.

On my final day Evan was out so i could not finish taking the pipes apart.
-  i cleaned the doors of the fuel intake cabinets they were building before learning (roughly) how to weld.

#### What I learned
I learned that physics and chemistary are both important in mechanical engineering.

I learned that it is important to pressure test every pipe to 1.3 times the pressure the are expected to experience while in use.

I learned that it takes years to undergo a welding apprenticeship.
